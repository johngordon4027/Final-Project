# Risk Analysis (TAME)
Transfer - (shift the risk to a third party). Some risks are better handled by professionals or external partners.

Avoid - (eliminate the risk entirely). Certain risks can be prevented through disciplined decision making.

Mitigate - (reduce likelyhood or impact). Not all risks can be eliminated; mitigation reduces severity.

Embrace - (leverage positive risk). The tame framework recongnizes that uncertainty can create opportunity.
