### Project Purpose
#### I am opening a store so that I can be my own boss. I want to make my own rules, work hard, and make my own money.
---
### Description
#### Opening a store is very stressful and exciting at the same time. My store would consist of selling groceries, electronics, and home appliances. This project includes market research, funding, leasing space, build-out, hiring staff, and launching operations.
---
### Desired Results
#### Some specific steps to take in order to achieve my goal of opening a store would be getting a loan, doing research on where to open the store, and maintaining good customer service. Major expenses include lease agreements, inventory purchases, equipment, payroll, and marketing.
---
### Exclusions
#### Something I will not include will be the unnecessary use of complex digital software for the store's computer operating system. Choosing a simple interface for employees to interact with when checking customers out or returning item's is a lot more useful than having the most complex version right away. Another thing I will avoid would be an excessive startup cost. This includes expensive furniture and unnecessary renovations.
